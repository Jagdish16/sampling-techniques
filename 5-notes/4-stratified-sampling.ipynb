    "Stratification is the process of dividing members of the population into subgroups before sampling. The strata should define a partition of the population. That is, it should be collectively exhaustive and mutually exclusive: every element in the population must be assigned to one and only one stratum. Then simple random sampling or systematic sampling is applied within each stratum.\n",

In weighted sampling we first applying a simple random sample, and then weighing members of the sample according to assumptions about the underlying population.\n",
