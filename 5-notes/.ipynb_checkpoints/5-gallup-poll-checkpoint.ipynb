    "mission of polling was to amplify the voice of the public, not distort it, and we continue to be inspired by that mission.\n",

Did previous presidents with this rating at the equivalent point in time tend to get re-elected or not? Then it can be compared to approval ratings of Congress, of the Republican and Democratic congressional leaders.\n",

    "The results to all Gallup surveys are in the \"public domain\" - once they have been publicly released by us, anyone who chooses may pick up the information and write about it themselves. The survey results are regularly published in the major media, in the Gallup Poll Monthly, and on several electronic information services such as Nexus, the Roper Center and the Internet.
